SlimDX
======

This is an old experimental branch of SlimDX to investigate robust code generation from the DX headers. We hit upon an even better idea of parsing the IDL files, but everyone lost motivation when Microsoft introduced Windows 8 and simultaneously killed off the DirectX SDK, so work stopped.

Our mainline version can be found at https://github.com/SlimDX/slimdx. That project was declared feature complete and put into maintenance mode a while back. If your organization still uses it and has issues with existing functionality, we will attempt to help you out.
